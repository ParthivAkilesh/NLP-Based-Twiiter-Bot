1,"""There are Friends, there's Family but then there are Friends that become Family""


27th October 2021 Last year, this marks the first day I stepped into this beautiful place, met all these beautiful people and became a part of KPR.

Every student's first day of college is truly unique and memorable.
It's hard for someone to forget the first day of entering into the real college life after seeing the reel college life.

I was a kind of person who was an introvert to the core and I always find it hard to socialize with people around me.
But these people in the picture changed me slowly. I gradually started to mingle with a few of them and became selectively extrovert.

Now each person I met so far have a special place and play a special role in my life. We all share laughters and tears together.

This one year journey which include all sort of emotions starting from several dramas to severe traumas etc..has taught so many things in life. Each and every day I learn something new from the people around me and from my surrounding. Life is all about learning right..?

Initially I kind of regretted the choices I made in life but now that I'm really grateful for what I have and who I am.

But I'm really grateful for the support which is being provided for me by my Institute KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology and the person who inspired me the most so far with her talks and actions and who would bring a smile in everyone's face is my beloved Principal Akila Muthuramalingam

I've never seen a person in my life who's so dedicated to the role which she has be given to play as a leader of the institution.


And I thank each and every one of them in this picture for supporting me in my hard times and sharing all your good times with me.

5,"Millions of people throughout the world rejoice for five days during Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights or Deepavali. The Hindu month of Kartik, which usually falls between October and November, is when it occurs. The dates for this year's Diwali are October 23, 2022, through October 27, 2022. However, October 24, 2022, will be the event's largest day. The central message of Diwali is that light triumphs over darkness and good over evil. Due to this, lighting up their life with fireworks, candles, and lanterns is another aspect of the Diwali celebration. In addition, people decorate their homes with colour by making elaborate designs known as rangolis out of coloured powder, rice, and flowers.


Have a blessed and beautiful Diwali full of celebrations, festivities and feasts with your near and dear ones

9,"Why people hesitate to opt Civil Engineering course nowadays???
The Civil Engineering graduates are jobless is the answer.
Is this true??
Not at all. Even in this pandemic situation there are lots of vacancies for Civil Engineer Job.
Then where does the pblm arise?
It is in the mind of people. We always believe what we hear.
If we analyse before we believe,we can determine the truth.
The truth is ,the mindset of the people should be changed.
Civil Engineering is an evergreen field where varieties of jobs are available. The students are free to choose the field that suits them the best.
If a student studies well during the course of study and if the student gains more practical knowledge during the four years of the course and if the student is willing to take up the job with full positive mindset and if the student is able to manage and copeup with the timings during his/her work then the student will definitely be a successful Civil Engineer.
This is the only field that gives life to non-living materials like building, bridge,dams etc.
The only field that makes many entrepreneurs is Civil Engineering.
Rather than sitting in AC Room and working,it gives a heartfelt satisfaction when you create a AC Room for others to sit and work. This can be felt only by a Civil Engineer.
If you change your mindset and if you learn more and practice more you can become a successful Civil Engineer/Entrepreneur.
Civil Engineers create footprint wherever they go.The buildings that we construct are our Pride.Be proud to be a Civil Engineer.
A successful path is approaching you,be ready to travel in it with full of enthusiasm.
